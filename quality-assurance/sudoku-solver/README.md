# Sudoku Solver

**Status:** Not Passed

## Overview
Builds and solves Sudoku puzzles using algorithmic logic via a RESTful API.

## Tech
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Express
- Algorithmic logic for backtracking solver
- Mocha + Chai

## How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm start

What Didn't Pass

Solver failed on puzzles with multiple solutions.

Grid validation not catching invalid input formats.

Test cases failed due to logic loop bugs.

TODO

Refactor solve() function to improve recursion logic.

Fix validation for row/column/region uniqueness.

Write extra unit tests for edge puzzles.

Optimize performance to prevent timeouts.

Learning Outcome

Strong exercise in logic, testing, and recursive problem solving under real constraints.
