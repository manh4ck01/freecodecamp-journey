# Cash Register

**Status:** Not Passed

## Overview
A JS function that simulates a cash register drawer. Calculates change to return based on available denominations and handles edge cases.

## Tech
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in your browser or run `cashRegister()` in the console with test data.

## What Didn't Pass
- Floating point precision caused incorrect change calculations.
- “Insufficient Funds” and “Closed” conditions not handled correctly.

## TODO
- Add proper rounding using `toFixed()` or math functions.
- Improve object structure for drawer and change outputs.
- Align logic with FreeCodeCamp's expected return format.

## Learning Outcome
Strengthened problem-solving and precise handling of financial calculations in JS.
