# JavaScript Calculator

**Status:** Not Passed

## Overview
A basic calculator that supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with chaining logic.

## Tech
- React
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
## What Didn't Pass
Expression chaining didnâ€™t follow order of operations.

Display glitches on repeated equals (=) press.

Some test cases failed due to floating-point rounding.

## TODO
Improve expression evaluation logic using regex or math parser.

Handle edge cases: multiple decimals, division by zero, etc.

Match FCC's exact output format and layout.

## Learning Outcome
Advanced understanding of controlled components and event handling in complex forms.
